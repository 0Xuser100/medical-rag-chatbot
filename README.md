## 🧠 Advanced Memory System

### How Memory Works

The chatbot features sophisticated conversational memory:

- **🔄 Context Retention**: Remembers what you've discussed throughout the conversation
- **🎯 Follow-up Awareness**: Understands references like "What are the symptoms?" after asking about diabetes
- **📊 Smart Memory Types**:
  - **Window Memory** (≤10 messages): Keeps recent conversation turns
  - **Summary Memory** (>10 messages): Summarizes old content, maintains recent context
- **💭 Memory Indicators**: UI shows conversation length and active memory type

### Example Conversation Flow

```
You: "What is diabetes?"
AI: "Diabetes is a chronic condition where blood sugar levels are too high..."

You: "What are the symptoms?"  ← AI knows you're still asking about diabetes
AI: "The symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination..."

You: "How is it treated?"  ← AI maintains context about diabetes
AI: "Diabetes treatment involves blood sugar monitoring, medication..."
```
